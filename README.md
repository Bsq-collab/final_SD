### Overview
Americas's Game. It will live forver in the hearts of the millions that spend their afternoons watching it. Day by day, episode by episode, the country began to fall in love with the hosting capabilities of Pat Sajak, while simultaneously exercising their minds in their search for the correct phrases. When guessed letters matched, the board would light up with the help of Vanna White, and the viewer would grow one step closer to guessing the answer. Now, for the first time ever in our software development class, Team ViBayan and Helibnul has reconstructed this game for the good of everyone.

After all, it is an educational game.
